Frontend exercise refactored from a vanilla JS excercise by Brad Traversy (https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects/blob/master/movie-seat-booking/). It displays movies taken from a local json with prices that can be calculated with different currencies collected from an API and selecting seats calculating the price which is saved in localstorage.
